# dh-marfeel-test
This a frontend test given by Marfeel as a technical test.

### General Comments: 

**1.-** This JavaScript application was built as a complete project. The main element itself is not seen as a component because it is built as a set of components. That's why styles are divided among different modules as I'm working with Sass. I made use of webpack to bundle this application. Inside webpack's configuration I'm making use of babel and Sass modules to compile code and make it work on any browser with no issue at all.

**2.-** You can access to all files of the project, even my webpack config files.

**3.-** I deployed this application using Heroku, so you can access through this link: https://dh-marfeel-test.herokuapp.com/. Otherwise you will need to set up a static server that could watch dist folder to access the application.

**4.-** I prepared some tests using Jasmine, but as the logic behind is not so complex, I made them as examples. And I ran jasmine using its standalone version.
